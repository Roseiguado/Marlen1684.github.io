<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>My name is Marlen Brito. I'm a code student. I live with my 3 kids in a very small but cuzy apartment. 
That aparment is our little piece of heaven. We have a beautiful and silly dog called Pepita.
I'm totally in love with this new journey in my life. Be here, at school learning again, it's a dream come true.</p>
   
# Goals

I just started the CTRL+SHIFT Code Scool.
My goal is be prepared, be successful. I want to learn everything about computer science. I really want to become a good developer. Then I'll be a better provider for my kids.
I would like to say that I'm doing this only for them, but no. I'm doing this for me too.
I just learn that the only way to teach them and guide them to the right way in life it's through my example.
I just want to have every single tool to be a good person, good mother and a successful women.
