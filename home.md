# About Me

My name is Marlen Brito. I'm a code student. I live with my 3 kids in a very small but cuzy apartment. 
That aparment is our little piece of heaven. We have a beautiful and silly dog called Pepita.
I'm totally in love with this new journey in my life. Be here, at school learning again, it's a dream come true.

# Goals

I just started the CTRL+SHIFT Code Scool.
My goal is be prepared, be successful. I want to learn everything about computer science. I really want to become a good developer. Then I'll be a better provider for my kids.
I would like to say that I'm doing this only for them, but no. I'm doing this for me too.
I just learn that the only way to teach them and guide them to the right way in life it's through my example.
I just want to have every single tool to be a good person, good mother and a successful women.

### Just Talking About Dreams

The first time I had contact with a computer I was 16 years old. I was in high school. The emotion that I felt at the beginning and my dreams about to learn, disappeared quickly. There were only three computers for a group of thirteen students. 
And guess what? The students who had access to computers and learn, were always the same ones. I wasn’t one of them, of course. The others (me included) had to stay behind them just watching, without understanding anything about the class or what the teacher said. 
Those moments were full of bad ideas in my head. I though over and over again that I would never learn anything about computers. I completely ignored my dream because of that. I honestly still don't know how I got credits for that assignment. I felt that I had been passionate about something that would never be possible for me.  

Can you see how easy is to give up on your dreams? I just had a very small school and a teacher who focused only on a few students to feel unable to achieve  my goals. From that time until now I rarely had real contact with computers.

It seems like I'm talking about a person from an other era, right? Well, no! This is me. This is just a small piece of the long history of my life and how I got here.

From there until now, I took an attitude of rejection towards technology. It really became an issue for me. Now I know it was a reaction to what had already been installed in my mind: “I can’t do it”
The influence of that terrible idea has been so big, that I was even afraid about damaging my own cell phone because I didn’t  know how to use it correctly,and I still don't know, to be honest. Afraid about not doing the right thing. I just learn a few very basic things with computers in the library. And I have to repeat this, I’m passionate about learning everything that has to do with computers or technology and being good at it! But for my mind was impossible, at that time.

We have to be very carefully with our thoughts, because sometimes, we put things in our minds that limit us in to many ways and it can be catastrophic sometimes. You end up believing that you are not capable of doing  something that you really like.

What change? I became a mother. Very soon I saw myself asking my son for help (about very easy things honestly). He was only ten years old. What a shame! And guess what? I realized that I was turning my fears on him. Why? Because I would never allow him to do something that I didn't understand. The lack of knowledge and my fears stopped me for many years and now I was doing the same to my own son without intention. All this clicked something in my head. 

Now the desire to learn returned, but suddenly I was lost in a world that looked nothing like the one I lived 19 years ago. I felt trapped in time. Now I felt old and clumsy to learn and do something different. I thought for a moment that it was late to star again. Just for a moment. 

Now let me tell this, it took me almost twenty years to turn my head again to that dream that I had when I first used a computer; and the only thing the teacher allowed me to do that day, was to change the size of the font. Yes, only that! 
Life happens. No doubt. But no matter what, let’s turn to what one day made us dream. And that will be the first step of our journey. Don't accept the tricks of your mind looking for logical reasons to quit. Just dream again... Be brave!

### Overcoming Obstacles

The last week a talked about dreams and goals in life and how easy it's to lose them along the way. Now it's time to talk about life responding to what we ask...

There are opportunities that we have waited for a lifetime, and that wait put us in a very foggy place sometimes. Believe me, there is nothing wrong on that. Everything goes wrong when we are unable to be patient but a fighter at the same time. Is bad when we don't know how to distinguish the good things that we have, and the worst moment is when we are blind and closed to the world.

If you have been in that foggy place, you will know that in the distance there are always lights that direct us through the darkness or we would be completely lost. For me, one of that lights was the need for knowledge and the desire to learn something different someday.

The first time I had an opportunity in front of me, after so many years, I was filled with fears, panicked to be honest. I realized very soon that the opportunities never come alone, they come with many obstacles and very huge challenges sometimes.

Now,  we must analyze our ability to adapt ourselves to the changes, our strength to face the obstacles we will have and the conviction of working hard on our weaknesses.

There will be a lot of difficulties and challenges on our way. May be we will lost friendships, we may have financial problems, illnesses, stress, loneliness, maybe nobody believes in you. It can be happening everything at the same time! But nothing should be stronger than all those lights that we have just in front of us to be reached. 

I still have to many questions without an answer, but there is something that I'm pretty sure...I know how obstacles can impact our lives in a positive way if we are willing to learn from them. I know the amazing way that our character is strengthened in those moments of darkness.

The best way to overcome obstacles is to face them, even if you have a million fears. In those moments, when you feel insane or unable to make it, you must know two things: you are worth it, and you can do it.

A good friend told me once: "Just believe in you". Believe me...it works.
