# About Me

My name is Marlen Brito. I'm a code student. I live with my 3 kids in a very small but warming apartment. 
That aparment is our little piece of heaven. We have a beautiful and silly dog called Pepita.
I'm totally in love with this new journey in my life. Be here, at school learning again, it's a dream come true.


# Goals

I just stared the CTRL+SHIFT Code Scool.
My goal is be prepared, be successful. I want to learn everything about computer science. I really want to become in a good developer. I'll be a good provider for my kids.
I would like to say that I'm doing this for them, but no. I'm doing this for me.
I just learn that the only way to teach them and guide them to the right way in life it's through my example.
i just want to have every single tool to be a good person, good mother and a successful women.
